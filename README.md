The Idea came from a Twitch stream where a Follow or cheering of some Bits activated a Water Fountain
and a Dispenser to feed some Chickens in a Backyard.

This Project was not Open Source at the start.
That was my very first “Big” own Project and I wanned to learn, do mistakes, fix Bugs and try to make a good software.
It was a fun and challenging Experience but know i missing the time and the "drive" to even fix little Bugs or add some Features.

With a Userbase of 1k Streamers and up to 100 per Day ... i never imagined so many People would use and like this Software.
So thats why im opening this Code to the public ... with some hope that there are other People to continue this Project.

So thats the Story
