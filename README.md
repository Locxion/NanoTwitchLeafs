# About

Nanotwitchleafs was originally build to let your Twitch Chat play with your Nanoleaf Lights with simple Chat Commands.
First Commit made 09.01.2019 it evolved in a Connection between Twitch and the real World.
Supporting right now:
- Chat Commands and Keywords
- Alerts like new Follower, Subscriptions, Cheering Bits, Raids and Hypetrain Events
- Channelpoint Redemptions
- Integration with [Hyperate.io](https://www.hyperate.io/) ![HyperateIcon](https://assets.website-files.com/60fab9af722573947d71e73b/619cbce54830e07b08f3fcce_HypeRate_Logo_32.png)
- Donation Alerts (Only StreamLabs)

The Idea came from a Twitch stream where a Follow or cheering of some Bits activated a Water Fountain
and a Dispenser to feed some Chickens in a Backyard.

This Project was not Open Source at the start.
That was my very first “Big” own Project and I wanned to learn, do mistakes, fix Bugs and try to make a good software.
It was a fun and challenging Experience, but now I'm missing the time and the "drive" to even fix little Bugs or add some Features.

With an Userbase of 1k Streamers and up to 100 per Day ... I never imagined so many People would use and like this Software.
So that's why im opening this Code to the public ... with some hope that there are other People to continue this Project.

So that's the Story
